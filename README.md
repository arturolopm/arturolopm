Hello, I'm Arturo Lopez!
👨‍💻 As a tech enthusiast, I'm passionate about exploring how technology can improve people's lives. I recently made a career change from business management to coding, and I'm loving it!

💻 My favorite technology stack is the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, with React being my top favorite. I just love how it allows me to create interactive and dynamic web applications with ease.

🚀 I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects with great potential, even if the odds are not in their favor. I believe that someone needs to take on the hard stuff and create solutions that make a difference.

📧 Feel free to reach out to me at carturolopezm@gmail.com to discuss potential collaborations or opportunities.
